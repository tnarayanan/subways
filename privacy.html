        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy covers what information is collected by the
        "Subways" app created by Tejas Narayanan.
        It is effective as of January 1, 2025, and reflects Subways v1.0.0.</p>

        <p>Subways does not collect any information about users. Specifically,
        users do not create an account or provide any personal information
        to use the app.</p>

        <p>Subways stores users' favorite stations and most-recently-viewed station
        on-device. This information is not used for analytics purposes.</p>

        <p>Subways makes data requests to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) API
        (<a href="https://api.mta.info/#/subwayRealTimeFeeds">linked here</a>)
        to get real-time subway arrival data. These requests do not supply the
        MTA or any other party with any information about the user.</p>

        <p>In summary, Subways does not collect any user information! It is designed
        to be as simple and privacy-conscious as possible, meaning that no user data
        leaves users' devices.</p>
